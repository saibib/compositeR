Description: This package is used to create variable weights in composite indices to achieve target variable importances by using Shapley Effects as a definition of variable importance. An objective function is defined to minimze the distance between a target vector of importances and a resultant vector of Shapley Effects from a given vector of weights. Other functions are included for common variable aggregation methods and winner selection.
